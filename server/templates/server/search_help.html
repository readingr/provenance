		<h3>Searching</h3>
		<p>The PROV Server supports searching capabilities both on the webUI and on trough
		the API. All the searches would always give back bundles you have permissions at least
		to view. There are five types of different searches that are supported: By Name, By Identifier,
		By prov:type, In Timeframe and searching in for any text field. Searching on the webUI is done
		by going to the search page and inputting any parameters required for the search. You can select
		the type of search to execute via the drop down list. On the API search is supported ONLY via 
		'GET' method. When you execute such method you should append the parameter 'search_type' with 
		five possible values: 'Name', 'Identifier', 'prov_type', 'Timeframe' or 'Any' - representing
		each of the supported search types. After this parameter you should append any relevant to the 
		search parameters(for all except 'Timeframe' this is just a variable 'q_str' representation the 
		query string, and for 'Timeframe' there are 2 variables - 'start' and 'end' where you could 
		omit one of them if needed, but at least one must be provided). Do not forget to add your 
		authentication header when requesting a search or you might be treated as anonymous user.
		An example request to the API for searching would look like this:
<pre>
type: 'GET',
url: 'https://www.example.com/api/v0/bundle/?format=json&search_type=Name&q_str=test',
contentType: 'application/json',
headers: [('Authorization' : auth)]
</pre>
		<p>For the following examples assume that we have stored in the database the following JSON bundle
		with record_ID 'test_bundle':</p>

		<div id="name" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>By Name</h3>
		<p>Searching by name would find out all the Top-level bundles which names contains the 
		string provided. For the example above searching for "bob:bundle" would not retrieve the 
		bundle as it is not the top level one. Search for "test", "bundle" on the other hand would
		give back the bundle.
		</p>
		<div id="id" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>By Id</h3>
		<p>Searching by ID would retrieve all the bundles with records whose names contain the string.
		For the example above if we search for "bob" that would retrieve the bundle as the inner one
		is by it self a record. Do not forget that not only bundles are records. For instance searching 
		for the keyword 'report' would yield a result containing the example bundle as the entity 'report1' 
		is yet another record.</p>
		<div id="prov" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>By prov:	type</h3>
		<p>Searching by prov:type is quite straight forward - it would retrieve any bundles which contain
		records with the given prov:type. In our example searching by prov:type with keywords 'report' or
		'prov:Bundle' would retrieve the 'test_bundle', or any strings contained in these two.
		</p>
		<div id="time" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>In Timeframe</h3>
		<p>Searching in a time frame is a bit different from the rest search options. Given a times in
		the format 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss for the API) for a start and end of the interval
		this would retrieve any bundles which contain any kind of information in that time interval. In our
		example if we search in the interval[2012-05-24 : 2012-05-25] would retrieve the bundle. The search
		can accept and only one argument, either start or end, and would retrieve all bundles with information
		after that date(for start) or before that date(for end). Searching with start = '2012-05-24T10:00:00'
		would give back the example bundle, but searching with end = '2012-05-24T06:30:00' would not give the bundle
		as all the information in the bundle at it's earliest at 2012-05-24T10:30:00.
		</p>
		<div id="text" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Any text field</h3>
		<p>Searching for a string in any text field would return all the bundles which contain any information
		that would match the given string, no matter record ID, type, direct names of entities etc.
