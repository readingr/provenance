		<h3>OAuth</h3>
		<p>The PROV-JSON API supports OAuth protocol for authentication and authorization. 
		The API supports the common web server application flow for using the protocol. In it's core
		the OAuth would be registering an application with the web service and when needed to access 
		you redirect the browser to a given URL, parse the token from the response and use it to 
		for accessing the resource. For a more detail information of the flow of the protocol and 
		the security framework we suggest to read the official <a href="http://hueniverse.com/oauth/">
		OAuth Guide</a>. This guide will explain how to use the protocol for authentication and 
		authorization of the PROV-JSON web service.
		</p>
		<div id="Registration" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Registering an App</h3>
		<p>The first thing in order to register an App is to create an account, if you have not done so already.
		This will give you access to the PROV-JSON webUI where you can very easily manage and see
		all the resources and application linked to your account. When you are logged in you can go to the
		Apps panel and select Add New to open the registration form for an app. After the registration is complete
		in the Apps panel you are going to see all the application currently registered to your account
		together with the Client Key and Client Secret associated with them which you are going to need
		for accessing the API with OAuth.
		</p>
		<div id="workflow" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Workflow</h3>
		<p>The flow of obtaining Access Token is well defined by the OAuth specifications
		and we will demonstrate it here in practice with the PROV-JSON API. Let's assume 
		that John is a developer which wants to use the OAuth protocol to access user
		resources and he has a web application. He registers his application on the 
		webUI site, and the result of the registration would look like this:
		</p>
<pre>
Name : John's App
Description : A friendly application for displaying resources.
Consumer_Key : dpf43f3p2l4k3l03
Consumer_Secret : kd94hf93k423kf44
</pre>
		<div id="Request" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Obtaining Request Token</h3>
		<p>
		On his application John now have to create a function to obtain a Request Token
		from the PROV-JSON Server. This is done by either a GET or POST request to
		http://www.example.com/oauth/request_token with the following parameters included
		in the request:
<pre>
oauth_consumer_key : dpf43f3p2l4k3l03
oauth_signature_method : PLAINTEXT
oauth_signature : kd94hf93k423kf44,
oauth_timestamp : 1191242096
oauth_nonce : kllo9940pd9333jh
oauth_version : 1.0
oauth_callback : http://johns_domain/request_token_ready
scope: api
</pre>
		<p>These parameters can be included in different places in the request according to
		the OAuth Specifications - "The parameters are collected from three locations: 
		the URL query element (as defined by RFC 3986 section 3), the OAuth 'Authorization' 
		header (excluding the 'realm' parameter), and parameters included in a single-part 
		'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' POST body (as defined by HTML4)."<br>
		Assuming Jane visits Johns App and decides that she wants to check out Johns
		visualization of the provenance, when she clicks to connect to her account 
		obtaining the Request Token is the first thing to do. A corespoding response would
		contain the following information:
		</p>
<pre>
oauth_token_secret : Qc7bPafBTku2yT7X
oauth_token : 6e63d062712c4381a559eaf5887a64ef
oauth_callback_confirmed : true
</pre>	
		<div id="UserAuth" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Obtain User Authorization</h3>
		<p>
		After obtaining the Request Token now John's App have to get Jane's permission to
		access her resources. This happens by calling with GET or POST request the authorization
		URL www.example.com/oauth/authorize/ with only the ouath_token as parameter.
<pre>
oauth_token : 6e63d062712c4381a559eaf5887a64ef
</pre>
		<p>The response returned from the server would be a redirect and the 'Location' header will
		contain the URL to which Johns App have to redirect Jane. When this happen Jane would be
		presented with the login to the webUI server and when she logged in she would be given a 
		choice to grant access to her data to John's App. When she grants that access she will be 
		redirected back to the oauth_callback URL (http://johns_domain/request_token_ready) with 
		attached two extra arguments - oauth_token and oauth_verifier, and John's Reques Token 
		will be approved.
		</p>
<pre>
http://johns_domain/request_token_ready?oauth_verifier=8449664522&oauth_token=916197bbb7224e3facd7133c0ead7f52
</pre> 
		<div id="Access" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Obtain Access Token</h3>
		<p>
		Now all that is left to do for John is to exchange the Request Token for an Access Token 
		which is the Token used for the actual data. This can be done again by either GET or POST method
		to the URL www.example.com/oauth/access_token/ with the following parameters:
<pre>
oauth_consumer_key : dpf43f3p2l4k3l03
oauth_token : 6e63d062712c4381a559eaf5887a64ef
oauth_signature_method : PLAINTEXT
oauth_signature : kd94hf93k423kf44&Qc7bPafBTku2yT7X
oauth_timestamp : 1191242096
oauth_nonce : kllo9940pd9333jh
oauth_version : 1.0
oauth_verifier : 8449664522
scope : api
</pre>
		This will result in response from the server containing the Access Token given all the information
		provided was correct and flow of the protocol was followed. An example response body may look like this:
<pre>
oauth_token_secret : UUy9xz2b2YafykRJ
oauth_token : b7c21ff3256447078a2de2a9572be44a
</pre>
		<p>Now when John's App have acuired the Access Token it can access Jane's provenance resources.
		</p>
		<div id="Example" class="anchorOffset"></div>
		<h3>Example Request with Access Token</h3>
		<p>
		An example request to the API using such Access Token:
<pre>
oauth_consumer_key : dpf43f3p2l4k3l03
oauth_token : b7c21ff3256447078a2de2a9572be44a
oauth_signature_method : 'HMAC-SHA1',
oauth_timestamp : now
oauth_nonce : accessresourcenonce
oauth_version :  1.0
</pre>
		<p>The URL path of the request would be 'www.example.com/api/bundle/X/' asssuming Jane is
		the owner of bundle with ID 'X'. Don't forget that you have to add one more parameter ot the request - 
		the oauth_signature which is a digest using the given signature_method of a special oauth Request object.
		Most languages have support of already build libraries for creating such object given the Access Token,
		the URL and the parameters above. After adding the oauth_signature to the parameter list John is ready
		to make a request to 'www.example.com/api/bundle/X/?format=json' (don't forget the format=json argument)
		and successfully retrieve Jane's resource.
		</p>
