Cron Job Functionality

The gem ``whenever'' is used to control the cron functionality.

To start a cron job, use the commands:

``whenever''

``whenever -w''

to clear cron jobs use

``whenever -c''

and to view the cron jobs you can use

``crontab -e'' (technically for editing but you can close without saving)
